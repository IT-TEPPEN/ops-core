# ADR 0011: Backend File Splitting Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The backend program has grown significantly, resulting in large files that are difficult to maintain and navigate. This has led to challenges in understanding, testing, and extending the codebase. To address this, we need a clear strategy for splitting files while minimizing potential issues such as excessive fragmentation or loss of cohesion.

## Decision

We will adopt the following file splitting strategy for the backend program:

1. **Splitting Criteria:**
    - Files exceeding 500 lines of code should be reviewed for potential splitting.
    - Each file should ideally focus on a single responsibility or closely related functionalities.
    - Avoid splitting files if it results in excessive inter-file dependencies or violates the principle of cohesion.

2. **Module Organization:**
    - Group related files into modules or packages based on their domain or functionality.
    - Follow the existing directory structure (e.g., `domain/`, `usecases/`, `infrastructure/`) to maintain consistency.

3. **Naming Conventions:**
    - Use descriptive and meaningful names for new files to reflect their purpose.
    - Avoid generic names like `utils.go` unless absolutely necessary.

4. **Refactoring Process:**
    - Refactor incrementally to avoid introducing bugs or breaking changes.
    - Ensure that tests are updated or added to cover the refactored code.

5. **Review and Approval:**
    - All file splitting changes must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Improved maintainability and readability of the codebase.
  - Easier navigation and understanding of individual components.
  - Enhanced testability and modularity.

- **Cons:**
  - Initial effort required to refactor and split existing large files.
  - Potential for temporary disruption during the refactoring process.

By adopting this strategy, we aim to strike a balance between maintainability and cohesion, ensuring the backend program remains scalable and easy to work with.
